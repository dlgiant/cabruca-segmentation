# ✅ Deployment Setup Complete

## Summary

The repository has been successfully configured with environment-based deployments and branch protection rules.

## What Was Configured

### 1. **Branch Protection** 🔒
- Main branch now requires pull requests
- Direct pushes are blocked (except for admins)
- Requires 1 approval for merging
- Stale reviews are dismissed automatically
- Conversations must be resolved before merging

### 2. **Environment Configurations** ⚙️
- **Production** (`main` branch):
  - Higher resources (1024 CPU, 2048 Memory)
  - Multiple instances for high availability
  - Caching enabled for performance
  - Debug mode disabled
  
- **Staging** (all other branches):
  - Lower resources (256 CPU, 512 Memory)
  - Single instance for cost savings
  - Debug and profiling enabled
  - Used for testing and development

### 3. **GitHub Actions Workflows** 🚀
- **CI Pipeline**: Runs on all PRs (lint, test, security scan)
- **Staging Deploy**: Automatic on feature branches
- **Production Deploy**: Automatic on merge to main

### 4. **Deployment Scripts** 📦
- `deploy.sh`: Smart deployment based on current branch
- `setup-branch-protection.sh`: Configure GitHub branch rules
- Environment-specific configurations in `configs/`

### 5. **Web Interface** 🌐
All services are currently running and accessible:

#### Staging Environment (Current)
- ✅ Health: http://cabruca-stg-alb-428619257.sa-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health
- ✅ API: http://cabruca-stg-alb-428619257.sa-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api
- ✅ Dashboard: http://cabruca-stg-alb-428619257.sa-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/dashboard
- ✅ Streamlit: http://cabruca-stg-alb-428619257.sa-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/streamlit

## Next Steps

### 1. Create Pull Request
```bash
# Go to GitHub and create a PR from feature/setup-deployment-workflow to main
# Or use GitHub CLI:
gh pr create --base main --title "Setup deployment workflow" --body "Configures environment-based deployments and branch protection"
```

### 2. Merge to Main
After PR approval, the changes will be merged and:
- Branch protection will be fully active
- Production deployment workflow will be ready
- All team members must use PRs for changes

### 3. Team Workflow
Going forward, all developers should:
1. Create feature branches from main
2. Push changes to feature branches
3. Create PRs for review
4. Merge after approval
5. Automatic deployment to staging/production

## Key Features

### GitOps Workflow
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All configs in Git
- **Automated Deployments**: Push to deploy
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate staging/production
- **Rollback Capability**: Git revert = deployment rollback

### Security & Quality
- **Branch Protection**: No accidental production changes
- **Code Review**: Required approvals
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy and secret detection

### Cost Optimization
- **Environment-based Resources**: Lower resources for staging
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale based on load
- **Budget Alerts**: Cost monitoring enabled

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Deploy based on current branch
./deploy.sh

# Manual staging deployment
git checkout feature/my-feature
./deploy.sh  # Deploys to staging

# Manual production deployment (from main only)
git checkout main
./deploy.sh  # Deploys to production (with confirmation)

# Check deployment status
