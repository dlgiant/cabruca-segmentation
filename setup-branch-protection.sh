# Branching Strategy

## Branch Protection
- **main**: Protected branch, requires PR and approval
- Direct pushes to main are **blocked**
- All changes must go through pull requests

## Branch Naming Convention

### Main Branches
- \`main\` - Production-ready code (uses production settings)
- \`develop\` - Integration branch for features (uses staging settings)

### Supporting Branches
- \`feature/*\` - New features (uses staging settings)
  - Example: \`feature/user-authentication\`
  - Example: \`feature/add-segmentation-model\`

- \`hotfix/*\` - Emergency fixes for production
  - Example: \`hotfix/fix-api-timeout\`
  - Example: \`hotfix/security-patch\`

- \`release/*\` - Release preparation
  - Example: \`release/v1.2.0\`

- \`bugfix/*\` - Bug fixes for develop branch
  - Example: \`bugfix/fix-memory-leak\`

## Workflow

1. Create a new branch from \`develop\`:
   \`\`\`bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   \`\`\`

2. Make your changes and commit:
   \`\`\`bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   \`\`\`

3. Push to GitHub:
   \`\`\`bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   \`\`\`

4. Create a Pull Request to \`develop\`
   - Automated staging deployment will run
   - Tests must pass
   - Code review required

5. After approval, merge to \`develop\`

6. When ready for production:
   - Create PR from \`develop\` to \`main\`
   - Production deployment runs automatically after merge

## Environment Mapping

| Branch Pattern | Environment | Configuration File |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| main          | Production  | configs/production.env |
| develop       | Staging     | configs/staging.env |
| feature/*     | Staging     | configs/staging.env |
| hotfix/*      | Staging     | configs/staging.env |
| release/*     | Staging     | configs/staging.env |

## Commit Message Convention

Follow the Conventional Commits specification:

- \`feat:\` New feature
- \`fix:\` Bug fix
- \`docs:\` Documentation changes
- \`style:\` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- \`refactor:\` Code refactoring
- \`test:\` Test additions or changes
- \`chore:\` Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- \`perf:\` Performance improvements

Example: \`feat: add image segmentation endpoint\`
